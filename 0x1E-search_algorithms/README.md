# Overview #

Like the name implies, **0x1E. C - Search Algorithms** introduces the **search algorithms** used in the world of *computer science and engineering.*

<hr/>

### Learning Objectives ###
It is expected that at the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs


### Requirements and Constraints ###
#### General ####
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Yu are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, â€¦ is forbidden.
- The prototypes of all your should be included in the header file called search_algos.h
- All your header files should be include guarded
